NARRATIVE = """Okay, let's see. I need to find the factored form of the first derivative of the polynomial -1/4x^4 + 8/3x^3 - 8x^2. Hmm. Alright, first step is probably to take the derivative. Let me remember how to do that. The derivative of x^n is n*x^(n-1), right? So for each term, I can apply that rule.

Starting with the first term: -1/4x^4. The derivative would be -1/4 * 4x^3. The 4 and the 1/4 cancel out, so that becomes -x^3.

Next term: 8/3x^3. The derivative is 8/3 * 3x^2. Again, the 3 cancels with the denominator, so that's 8x^2.

Third term: -8x^2. The derivative is -8 * 2x, which is -16x.

So putting it all together, the first derivative is -x^3 + 8x^2 -16x. Now I need to factor this expression. Let me write it as -x^3 + 8x^2 -16x. Maybe I can factor out a common term first. All the terms have an x, so factoring out an x gives x(-x^2 + 8x -16). But the coefficient of x^2 inside the parentheses is negative. Maybe I can factor out a negative sign as well. Let me see:

x(-x^2 +8x -16) = x*(-1)(x^2 -8x +16) = -x(x^2 -8x +16). Now, looking at the quadratic x^2 -8x +16. Is that factorable? Let's check the discriminant: bÂ²-4ac = 64 - 64 = 0. Oh, so it's a perfect square. Therefore, x^2 -8x +16 factors into (x -4)^2. So substituting back, we have -x*(x -4)^2. But the question says to present the factored form. However, sometimes people prefer not to have a negative sign in front. Let me check if I can adjust that.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the sign when factoring. Let me go back. Original derivative was -x^3 +8x^2 -16x. Factoring out an x gives x(-x^2 +8x -16). Alternatively, I could factor out a -x instead. Let's try that: -x(x^2 -8x +16). Which is the same as before. So that gives -x(x -4)^2. But the original problem might expect a certain format. Let me check if there's another way. Alternatively, if I factor out a negative sign from the entire expression. The original derivative is -x^3 +8x^2 -16x. If I factor out a negative sign, it's - (x^3 -8x^2 +16x). Then factor out an x: -x(x^2 -8x +16) = -x(x -4)^2. Same result. 

But maybe the answer expects it without the negative sign. Let me check if there's a different approach. Wait, when I took the derivative, maybe I made a mistake? Let me double-check the derivative. Original polynomial: -1/4x^4 +8/3x^3 -8x^2. Derivative term by term:

First term: d/dx (-1/4 x^4) = -1/4 *4x^3 ="""
