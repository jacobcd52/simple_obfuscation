  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to compute the product of 20 and -8 in the ring Z_26. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. First, I remember that in modular arithmetic, especially in Z_n, the product of two numbers is calculated by first multiplying them as integers and then taking the remainder when divided by n. In this case, n is 26. So, the problem is asking for (20 * -8) mod 26. \n\nBut wait, negative numbers can be tricky. I need to figure out what -8 is equivalent to modulo 26. Since we're working in Z_26, all elements are between 0 and 25. So, -8 mod 26 would be the same as 26 - 8, right? Because if I add 26 to -8, I get 18, which is positive. Wait, no, 26 - 8 is 18, so -8 \u2261 18 mod 26? Let me check that. If I take -8 + 26, that equals 18, so yes, -8 is congruent to 18 modulo 26. Therefore, -8 mod 26 is 18. \n\nSo then, 20 * -8 mod 26 is equivalent to 20 * 18 mod 26. Let me compute 20 times 18. 20 times 10 is 200, 20 times 8 is 160, so 200 + 160 is 360. So 20 * 18 is 360. Now I need to find 360 mod 26. \n\nTo compute 360 divided by 26, let's see. 26 times 10 is 260, 26 times 13 is 338 (since 26*10=260, 26*3=78; 260+78=338). Then 360 - 338 is 22. Therefore, 360 mod 26 is 22. Therefore, the product is 22. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that calculation because sometimes when you do modular",
