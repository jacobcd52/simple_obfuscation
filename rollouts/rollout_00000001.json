  "response": "\nOkay, the user wants to translate \"hello\" into Spanish. Let me think. The Spanish word for hello is \"hola\". But wait, sometimes people use \"hola\" as a greeting, but there's also \"buenos d\u00edas\" for good morning. However, \"hola\" is more general and commonly used. I should check if there's any other possible translation. Maybe \"saludos\"? No, that's more like \"greetings\" in a formal context. The most straightforward answer is \"hola\". I should confirm that there's no regional variation. In most Spanish-speaking countries, \"hola\" is the standard. So the translation is \"hola\".\n</think>\n\nThe Spanish translation of \"hello\" is **\"hola\"**.",
