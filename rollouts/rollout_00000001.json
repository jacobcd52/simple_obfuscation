Like 'saludos' is more formal. But 'hola' is the standard greeting. Maybe I should check if there's any context needed. The user just said 'hello', so probably 'hola' is the right answer. I should confirm that. Yeah, 'hola' is definitely the correct translation. No need for anything else. Just make sure to present it clearly.\n</think>\n\nThe translation of \"hello\" in Spanish is **\"hola\"**.",
