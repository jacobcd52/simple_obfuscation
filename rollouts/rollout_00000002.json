  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out these two statements. First, I need to recall what the internal direct product of two groups means. So, Statement 1 says that for finite groups G and H, the order of the internal direct product G + H is equal to the product of the orders of G and H. \n\nWait, I remember that the internal direct product of two groups G and H is a group that is isomorphic to the direct product G \u00d7 H. So, if G and H are both finite, then |G \u00d7 H| is indeed |G| * |H|. So the internal direct product, if it's written as G + H, would have the same order as the direct product. Therefore, Statement 1 should be true. Let me check again. If G and H are finite, then their internal direct product's order is |G| * |H|. So yes, Statement 1 is true.\n\nNow, moving on to Statement 2: If r divides m and s divides n, then Z_m + Z_n has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s. Hmm. Let me think. Z_m is the cyclic group of order m, and Z_n similarly. The internal direct product Z_m + Z_n would be the direct product Z_m \u00d7 Z_n. So the question is, does Z_m \u00d7 Z_n have a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r \u00d7 Z_s, given that r divides m and s divides n?\n\nWait, but Z_r \u00d7 Z_s is a subgroup of Z_m \u00d7 Z_n? Let me recall that if r divides m and s divides n, then Z_r \u00d7 Z_s is a subgroup of Z_m \u00d7 Z_n. Because if r divides m, then Z_m has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r, since m = r * k for some integer k. Similarly for n. Therefore, Z_m \u00d7 Z_n would have a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r \u00d7 Z_s. So, this would make Statement 2 true as well?\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Let me take m=4, n=6. So Z_4 \u00d7 Z_6. Suppose r=2 divides 4 and s=3 divides 6. Then Z_2 \u00d7 Z_3 is a subgroup of Z_4 \u00d7 Z_6. Is that true? Let's see. The order of Z_2 \u00d7 Z_3 is 6. The order of Z_4 \u00d7 Z_6",
