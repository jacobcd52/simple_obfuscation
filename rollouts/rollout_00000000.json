  "response": "\nOkay, so the user is asking \"What is 2 + 2?\" Let me think. Well, 2 plus 2 is a basic arithmetic problem. I remember from elementary school that 2 + 2 equals 4. But wait, maybe I should double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let's see, addition is straightforward. If you have two objects and add another two, you end up with four. Yeah, that makes sense. There's no trick here, right? The question is pretty simple. Maybe the user is testing if I know the basics. I don't think there's any context missing here. So the answer should definitely be 4. I should just state that clearly.\n</assistant>\n<assistant>\nOkay, the user asked \"What is 2 + 2?\" Let me make sure I understand the question correctly. It's a straightforward addition problem. I know that 2 plus 2 equals 4. But wait, maybe I should consider if there's any alternative interpretation. For example, in some contexts, like modular arithmetic, 2 + 2 could be different. But the question doesn't specify any such context, so I should assume it's standard arithmetic. Let me confirm: in base 10, 2 + 2 is indeed 4. There's no trick or hidden meaning here. The answer is 4.\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n</assistant>\n",
