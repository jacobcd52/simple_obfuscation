  "response": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking \"What is 2 + 2?\" Let me think. This is a straightforward math problem. The answer should be 4. But wait, maybe they want a more detailed explanation? Let me check the context. The user just asked the question, so probably a simple answer is enough. But I should make sure there's no trick here. In most cases, 2 + 2 is 4. However, sometimes people might think of different contexts, like in different number bases. For example, in binary, 2 is 10, so 10 + 10 is 100, which is 4 in decimal. But that's probably more advanced than needed. The user might just want the basic answer. Also, in some non-standard contexts, like in a game or a specific problem, it might have a different meaning, but without any additional information, the standard answer is 4. I should confirm that there's no hidden meaning or trick. Since there's none, the answer is definitely 4.\n</think>\n\nThe sum of 2 and 2 is **4**. \n\nIn standard arithmetic, $2 + 2 = 4$. This is a basic addition fact and holds true in the decimal (base-10) number system. If you're working in a different context (e.g., modular arithmetic, binary, or a specialized mathematical system), the result might vary, but unless specified otherwise, the answer is **4**.",
