  "response": "\nOkay, so the user is asking \"What is 2 + 2?\" Hmm, that seems straightforward. Let me think. Well, 2 plus 2 is a basic arithmetic problem. I remember from school that 2 + 2 equals 4. But wait, maybe I should double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me break it down. If you have two objects and add another two, you end up with four. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think there's any trick here. The question is pretty simple. Maybe the user is just testing if I can do basic math. Or maybe they want to confirm the answer. Either way, the answer should be 4. I should make sure I explain it clearly. Let me just visualize it: 2 apples plus 2 apples equals 4 apples. Yep, that's right. There's no ambiguity in this problem. So the answer is definitely 4. I don't need to complicate it further. Just state the answer clearly.\n</think>\n\nThe sum of 2 and 2 is **4**. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. Start with the number 2.  \n2. Add another 2 to it.  \n3. The result is 4.  \n\nSo, $ 2 + 2 = 4 $.",
