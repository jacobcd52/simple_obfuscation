  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I have these two statements to evaluate. Let me start by recalling what cyclic groups are. A cyclic group is a group that can be generated by a single element. So, for example, the integers under addition form a cyclic group, and so do the integers modulo n under addition. \n\nStatement 1 says: \"For every positive integer n there is a cyclic group of order n.\" Hmm. Well, I remember that the cyclic group of order n is usually denoted as Z_n, right? Which is the set {0, 1, 2, ..., n-1} under addition modulo n. So, for example, if n is 3, then Z_3 is {0,1,2} with addition mod 3. That's definitely a cyclic group of order 3. So if I take n as any positive integer, then Z_n is a cyclic group of order n. Therefore, Statement 1 seems to be true. \n\nWait, but is there another way to have a cyclic group of order n? Maybe other examples? Like the multiplicative group of complex roots of unity. For example, the nth roots of unity form a cyclic group under multiplication. That's another cyclic group of order n. So, regardless of how you look at it, for every n, there exists a cyclic group of order n. So Statement 1 should be true.\n\nNow moving to Statement 2: \"Every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group.\" Let me think. So if we have a cyclic group of order m, then for every divisor d of m, there should be an element of order d. \n\nLet me recall the theorem. In a cyclic group of order m, the number of elements of order d is \u03c6(d), where \u03c6 is Euler's totient function. So if d divides m, then \u03c6(d) is the number of elements of order d. So for example, in Z_6, which has order 6. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6. So elements of order 1: only the identity element, which is 0. Then elements of order 2: that's the element 3, since 3*2=6\u22610 mod 6. Similarly, elements of order 3: elements 2 and 4. Because 2*3=6\u22610, and 4*3=12\u22610",
