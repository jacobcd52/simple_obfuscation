  "response": "Thought Process:\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking \"What is 2 + 2?\" That seems straightforward. I need to make sure I understand the question correctly. It's a basic arithmetic problem. Adding two numbers, both 2. \n\nFirst, I should recall the rules of addition. In arithmetic, when you add two numbers, you combine their quantities. So 2 plus 2 would be combining two groups of two. Let me think, 2 + 2. If I have two apples and add another two apples, I should have four apples in total. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but maybe I should verify this with a different approach. Let's count. Starting at 2, adding 1 more would be 3, then another 1 would be 4. So that's two steps. So 2 + 2 equals 4. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the number line. Starting at 0, moving 2 units to the right gets me to 2. Then moving another 2 units gets me to 4. Yep, that's the same result. \n\nIs there any chance I could be confused here? Maybe if there's a different base system, but the question doesn't specify that. It's in base 10, I assume. So 2 + 2 in base 10 is definitely 4. \n\nI don't see any tricks or hidden parts in the question. It's a simple addition problem. So the answer should be 4.\n</assistant>\n</thought_process>\n<answer>4</answer>",
